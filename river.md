1. First, start the initial instance:

```bash
river --config-kdl ~/configs/river.kdl --daemonize --pidfile /tmp/river.pid
```

2. When you need to hot reload (e.g., after making config changes), start the new instance:

```bash
river --config-kdl ~/configs/river.kdl.https --upgrade --upgrade-socket /tmp/river-upgrade.sock --pidfile /tmp/river.pid
river --config-kdl ~/configs/river.kdl.https --upgrade --pidfile /tmp/river.pid
```

3. Then trigger the handover by sending SIGQUIT to the original process:

```bash
kill -SIGQUIT $(cat /tmp/river.pid)
```

Important notes:

- Make sure all paths are absolute
- Ensure directories exist and have proper permissions
- The upgrade socket functionality only works on Linux
- Both instances must use the same pidfile and upgrade socket paths
- Make backup copies of your configuration before making changes
- It's recommended to validate config changes before applying:

```bash
river --config-kdl ~/configs/river.kdl --validate-configs
sudo river --config-kdl ~/configs/river.kdl.https --validate-configs
rm configs/river.kdl.https && nano configs/river.kdl.https
river --config-kdl river.complex.kdl --validate-configs
```

This configuration sets up a reverse proxy that:

- Listens on ports 80 and 443 (with TLS)
- Load balances between two backend servers
- Adds a custom header to upstream requests
- Supports hot reloading for configuration changes
- Runs as a daemon process
